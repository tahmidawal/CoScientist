  "combined_hypothesis": "Unified Hypothesis: Dynamic Hard Negative Sampling in Disentangled Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning significantly enhances the transfer efficiency and robustness of multimodal foundation models. This approach proposes integrating dynamic negative sampling within a disentangled representation learning framework using cross-modal contrastive learning. We hypothesize that by learning to disentangle modality-invariant and modality-specific features while simultaneously employing dynamic hard negative sampling during contrastive pre-training, the resulting multimodal foundation model will acquire representations that are both semantically rich and adaptable. Specifically, dynamic hard negative sampling, informed by the disentangled feature spaces, will further refine the learned representations by forcing the model to distinguish subtle semantic differences within and across modalities, leading to superior generalization and efficient adaptation to downstream tasks, even with limited labeled data.",
