    "description": "Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods can be integrated with deep learning models to provide confidence estimates for the predicted Green's functions, addressing a critical aspect for reliable scientific applications. We hypothesize that Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) or ensemble methods can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with deep learning-based Green's function predictions, providing not just point estimates but also probabilistic information about the solution, which is crucial for assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of the predictions at arbitrary resolutions.",

    "description": "Meta-learning techniques can enable the development of models that can quickly adapt to learn Green's functions for new PDEs or domain geometries with minimal data or fine-tuning. We hypothesize that a meta-learning approach can train a model to learn a 'prior' over Green's function operators, allowing it to rapidly learn Green's functions for unseen PDEs or domains with only a few training examples, effectively generalizing beyond specific problem instances and reducing the need for extensive retraining for each new problem.",

We hypothesize that GNNs can effectively capture the spatial dependencies and boundary conditions on complex geometries, enabling the computation of Green's functions on domains where traditional mesh-based methods face challenges due to mesh generation complexity or quality degradation, thereby overcoming resolution limitations associated with mesh quality.",
