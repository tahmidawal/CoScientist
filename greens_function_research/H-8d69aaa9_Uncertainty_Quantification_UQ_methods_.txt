# RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## HYPOTHESIS H-8d69aaa9

Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods can be integrated with deep learning models to provide confidence estimates for the predicted Green's functions, addressing a critical aspect for reliable scientific applications. We hypothesize that Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) or ensemble methods can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with deep learning-based Green's function predictions, providing not just point estimates but also probabilistic information about the solution, which is crucial for assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of the predictions at arbitrary resolutions.

## COMPONENTS

1. Deep Learning model for Green's function prediction (e.g., Neural Operator, PINN)
2. Uncertainty Quantification techniques (e.g., Bayesian Neural Networks, Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout)
3. Quantified uncertainty estimates for Green's function predictions (e.g., confidence intervals, variance maps)
4. Validation metrics for uncertainty quantification (e.g., calibration, sharpness)
5. Datasets for evaluating uncertainty estimates

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

This implementation plan focuses on integrating Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods with Deep Learning (DL) models to provide confidence estimates for Green's function predictions. We will primarily explore two UQ techniques: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and Ensemble methods, within the context of a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture for Green's function learning. 

**BNN Approach:** We will implement a Bayesian DeepONet (B-DeepONet) by replacing standard layers in the DeepONet with Bayesian layers. These layers will have distributions over their weights and biases, allowing the network to learn a distribution over functions instead of a single function. We will use Variational Inference (VI) to approximate the intractable posterior distribution of the BNN parameters. Specifically, we will use Mean-Field Variational Inference, assuming independent Gaussian distributions for each weight and bias. The loss function will be modified to include a Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) term to regularize the posterior towards a prior distribution, alongside the standard data likelihood term.

**Ensemble Approach:** We will train an ensemble of DeepONets. Each DeepONet in the ensemble will be trained independently on a slightly different subset of the training data (e.g., using bootstrap sampling) or with different random initializations. The predictions from each network in the ensemble will be aggregated to estimate the mean prediction and the predictive uncertainty (variance). Different ensemble aggregation techniques, like simple averaging and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approximation, will be explored.

**Integration with DeepONet:** Both BNN and ensemble methods will be applied to a DeepONet architecture. The DeepONet is chosen for its ability to learn operators and its potential for resolution-independent computation, aligning with the broader research goal. The DeepONet will be trained to learn the Green's function operator that maps source functions and domain geometry to the solution field.

**Resolution Aspect:** While the core hypothesis is on UQ, we will ensure the experiments consider the 'arbitrary resolution' aspect. We will train the models on a range of resolutions and evaluate their performance and uncertainty estimates at resolutions both within and outside the training range. We will also investigate if UQ methods can provide insights into the model's reliability at different resolutions.
