# RESEARCH IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## HYPOTHESIS H-1bd1794e

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can be utilized to learn Green's functions on irregular or complex domains by representing the domain as a graph and learning the Green's function as a function on the graph nodes. We hypothesize that GNNs can effectively capture the spatial dependencies and boundary conditions on complex geometries, enabling the computation of Green's functions on domains where traditional mesh-based methods face challenges due to mesh generation complexity or quality degradation, thereby overcoming resolution limitations associated with mesh quality.

## COMPONENTS

1. Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture
2. Graph representation of the spatial domain (nodes representing spatial locations, edges representing connectivity)
3. Green's function values defined on graph nodes
4. Irregular or complex domain geometry
5. Training data generated on graph representations of domains

## TECHNICAL APPROACH

This implementation plan proposes using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn Green's functions on irregular and complex domains. The core technical approach involves representing the spatial domain as a graph and training a GNN to predict the Green's function values at the nodes of this graph. 

**Graph Construction:** The first step is to discretize the continuous domain into a set of points. For irregular domains, a structured or unstructured mesh can be used to define these points (vertices). These points will become the nodes of the graph. Edges in the graph will represent spatial relationships between these points. We will explore different graph construction methods:
    *   **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Graph:** Connect each node to its k-nearest neighbors in the spatial domain. This is suitable for capturing local spatial dependencies.
    *   **Distance-based Graph:** Connect nodes that are within a certain distance threshold of each other. This can be adapted to domain geometry.
    *   **Mesh-based Adjacency:** If a mesh is used for discretization (e.g., triangular mesh), the adjacency of mesh elements (vertices, edges, faces) can directly define the graph edges.

**GNN Architecture:** We will utilize a message-passing GNN architecture. Each node in the graph will have features representing its spatial coordinates, boundary conditions (if applicable), and potentially other domain properties. The GNN will iteratively update node features by aggregating information from their neighbors. We will explore different GNN layers:
    *   **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):** Using spectral or spatial graph convolutions to aggregate neighbor information.
    *   **GraphSAGE:**  Sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood.
    *   **Graph Attention Networks (GATs):** Using attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different neighbors during aggregation.

**Boundary Condition Handling:** Boundary conditions are crucial for defining Green's functions. We will incorporate boundary conditions into the GNN in several ways:
    *   **Node Features:** Encode boundary condition type (Dirichlet, Neumann, etc.) and values as node features for nodes located on the domain boundary.
    *   **Specialized Boundary Nodes:** Introduce separate 'boundary nodes' that are connected to domain nodes near the boundary and carry boundary condition information. 
    *   **Loss Function Regularization:** Incorporate boundary conditions into the loss function to explicitly enforce them during training.

**Training Process:** The GNN will be trained in a supervised manner. For each training sample (defined by domain geometry, source location, and PDE), we will:
    1.  Construct the graph representation of the domain.
    2.  Compute the ground truth Green's function values at the graph nodes using a numerical PDE solver (e.g., FEM) on the same discretized domain.
    3.  Train the GNN to predict these Green's function values, minimizing a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) between predicted and ground truth values.

**Resolution Independence (Graph Density):** While GNNs operate on graphs, the 'resolution' in this context relates to the density of nodes in the graph. We will investigate how the GNN performance scales with graph density. We hypothesize that GNNs can maintain accuracy even with relatively coarser graphs on complex domains where mesh refinement becomes challenging for traditional methods. We will test this by training and evaluating GNNs on graphs with varying node densities for the same domain.
